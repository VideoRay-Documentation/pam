<p>Connect the the 9-pin whip to the ROV, and isolate the orange, red, gray, blue, and brown wires. Place the board with the pinOut side facing upwards. In this position, the pin numbers
for the PAM board start at 1 in the upper right and increase towards the left. The diagram above also shows the function of each pin on the board in a color coded fashion. From this postition
begin soldering the wires in the following manner:
<ul>
	<li>Connect the Orange ground wire to pin 5.</li>
	<li>(Optional) If you are using 24V power, connect the Red 24V power wire to pin 3.</li>
	<li>Connect the Gray RS485- wire to pin 7.</li>
	<li>Connect the Blue RS485+ wire to pin 8.</li>
	<li>Connect the Brown 12V power wire to pin 9.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the typical attachment. For functions of the other wires stemming from the whip, please see this manuals <a href="../../pam/html/equipment_whip.html">
section on the 9-pin whip.</a></p>

<p>After you have connected the 9-pin whip correctly, the next step is to connect the wires from your serial device to the PAM board. The PAM board uses the row of pins
under the PinOUT set for the connection to serial devices. This is the PinIN side of the board. The following steps will successfully connect your device:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identify which wires on your device are communications, power, and ground.</li>
	<li>Connect your devices ground wire to pin 5.</li>
	<li>(Optional)If you are using 24V power, connect your devices 24V power wire to pin 3.</li>
	<li>Connect your devices communications pins.</li>
		<ul>	
			<li>If you are using an RS485 device, the connection order is reversed on this side. Connect your devices RS485+ wire to pin 7. Connect your devices
			RS485- wire to pin 8.</li>
			<li>If you are using an RS232 device, connect the TX wire of your device to pin 7. Connect the RX wire to pin 8. </li>
		</ul>
	<li>Connect your devices power.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If you are connecting a 12V device, connect your power wire to pin 9.</li>
			<li>If you are connecting a 24V device, connect your power wire to pin 3.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
<p>At this point your device should be successfully connected to the PAM. Proceed to set up the software to ensure that information is being received correctly.</p>
