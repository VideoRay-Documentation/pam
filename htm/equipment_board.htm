<p>The PAM board serves as an adapter for your serial device. It adapts the input from your device and allows your device to connect and interface with the ROV,
providing unprecedented end user customization.</p>

<p> The board contains a series of numbered pin connectors. Starting at the black arrow is pin 1, increasing as you move left. This row is the PinOUT side, connecting the
ROV's accessory port to the PAM board with the 9-pin whip. 

Each pin in the board corresponds to one of the pins from the accessory port. The row immediately below connects the serial device to the board. These two sets are connected to eachother through the board,
allowing connections to be made between the ROV and serial devices.</p>

<p>The board also contains a small feedback LED. When the board is receiving power, the light will emit a single blink every few seconds. When the board
is communicating, it will emit a series of blinks every few seconds.</p>
