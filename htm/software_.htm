<h1>Software Guide</h1>
<p>This section contains information on how to configure your software setup for your serial
device, and how to use Cockpit to access information about the PAM board and attached devices.</p>

<h2>Device Configuration</h2>
<p> <img src = "../../pam/images/icon_note.gif"> Note that in most cases the factory will configure the PAM for costumer use, and users will not
need to follow these steps to configure their devices. If you do need to configure your device yourself,
please continue.</p>

<p>The baud rate and the choice of RS485 or RS232 can be configured using the vrDeviceConfiguration tool. 
These settings are stored in EEPROM on the PAM.</p>

<h2>Cockpit Configuration</h2>
<p>Cockpit requires an accessory device file to be installed to use PAM.</p>
<p>The accessory device file informs Cockpit how to address the PAM(node id) as well as other parameters. If the accessory device file is
not installed cockpit will not communicate with the PAM and thus communication with the connected device is impossible.</p>
<p><img src ="../../pam/images/icon_note.gif"> Accessory device files can be created using the vrDeviceConfiguration tool. However,
a factory configured file is typically provided with the PAM.</p>
<p> Any factory configured files provided must be installed into the C:\Users\VideoRay\AppData\Local\VideoRay\AccessoryDevices\ directory
on the computer running cockpit. The accessory device file is an XML file with human readable file names.</p>
<p>There are two fields which may require user modification, in which case a plain text editor such as notepad can be used. The
file is formatted as such:</p>
<pre>
&lt;PortName&gt;
	&lt;SimpleName&gt;COM2&lt;/SimpleName>
	&lt;FriendlyName&gt;COM2&lt;/FriendlyName>
&lt;/PortName&gt;
&lt;BaudRate&gt;9600&lt;/BaudRate&gt; </pre>
<p>The PortName field designates which serial port will be used to relay the data.  
This can be a real or virtual comm port.  The BaudRate field sets the baud rate of the Relay port.</p>
<h2>Cockpit Diagnostics</h2>
<p align = "center"><img src ="../../pam/images/con_diag.png" width="550" height = "400" name = "viewt">
<p>Our Cockpit software allows you to monitor the status of all connected PAM devices in realtime.</p>
<ul>
	<li><!--v--><a name = "maintenance" onmouseover = "viewt.src=diagh.src"
onmouseout = "resett()"><!--/v--> First click the Maintenance and Diagnostic button
on the launch bar in Cockpit.<!--v--><img src="../../required/images/icon_hand.gif"></a><!--/v--></li> </ul>
<!--p--><p align = "center"><img src = "../../pam/images/diag_s1.png" width = "550" height = "400"></p><!--/p-->
	<ul><li><!--v--><a name "communications" onmouseover = "viewt.src=comms.src" onmouseout = "resett()"><!--/v-->From here press the show communications diagnostic window button on the service bay screen, and the
screen above will appear, allowing you to view data on your attached PAM devices.<!--v--><img src="../../required/images/icon_hand.gif"></a><!--/v--></li></ul>

<p>In most cases, how to operate your device during a dive will be included in the devices operating manual.
Instructions for how to operate all devices compatible with the PAM during a dive are outside the scope of this document,
but we encourage you to review any documents pertaining to your device to ensure the proper usage of all equipment.</p>
