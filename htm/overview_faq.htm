	<li><h3>What is the PAM?</li></h3>
	<p>The PAM is the Protocol Adapter Multiplexer. The PAM allows users to configure their own accessories for attachment to the ROV. It consists of two major parts,
	a connector that splits the individual pins from the accessory port, and the PAM board, which passes communication signals along to the ROV.</p>
	<li><h3>Who can use the PAM?</p></h3>
	<p>The PAM is intended for advanced users and developers. The PAM is designed to create a generic interface for developers to set up their accessories. Customization of the
	PAM requires certain skills, which are detailed in the <a href="../../pam/html/requirements_.html">requirements</a> portion of this manual.</p>
	<li><h3>What type of serial devices can be connected to the PAM?</li></h3>
	<p>Any devices that use RS485 or RS 232 communications and 12 or 24V power can be connected to the PAM.</p>
	<li><h3>How many devices can be connected to the PAM?</li></h3>
	<p>The PAM can be connected to one device, but multiple PAMS can be connected to a Pro4 system, allowing for multiple custom accessories.</p>
	<li><h3>How do I configure a generic PAM?</li></h3>
	<p>Instructions on how to configure the hardware for a generic serial device are in the <a href="../../pam/html/equipment_connection.html">equipment guide</a> of this manual.
	Instructions on how to configure the software are in the <a href="../../pam/html/software_.html">software guide</a></p> section of this manual. 
	More advanced configurations will vary depending on your device.</p>
	<li><h3>What does the LED on the PAM mean?</li></h3>
	<p>When solid, the LED indicates that the PAM is receiving power. When blinking, the LED indicates that the PAM is communicating.</p>
	<li><h3>How can I create an accessory device file?</li></h3>
	<p>In most cases, the accessory device file will be configured for you at the factory. If you need to configure the device yourself, please see the Device Configuration section of
	the <a href="../../pam/html/software_.html">software guide.</a></p>
	<li><h3>Where does the accessory device file go?</li></h3>
	<p>The default folder for the accessory device file is C:\Users\VideoRay\AppData\Local\VideoRay\AccessoryDevices\ on the computer running cockpit. This many change if the default
	installation has been modified. </p>
