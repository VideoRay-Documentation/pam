<h2>VideoRay Cockpit Configuration</h2>

<p>VideoRay Cockpit requires an accessory device configuration file to be installed to use a PAM enabled device.</p>

<p>The accessory device configuration file informs VideoRay Cockpit how to address the PAM (node id) as well as other parameters. If the accessory device configuration file is not installed VideoRay Cockpit will not communicate with the PAM.</p>

<p><img src ="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> Accessory device files can be created using the vrDeviceConfiguration tool. However, a factory configured file is typically provided with the PAM enabled accessory purchased from VideoRay.</p>

<p>PAM accessory Device configuration files provided must be installed into the <span class="folder">C:\Users\VideoRay\AppData\Local\VideoRay\AccessoryDevices\</span> folder.  The accessory device configuration file is an XML file with human readable file names.</p>

<p>There are two fields which may require user modification, in which case a plain text editor such as notepad can be used. The file is formatted as such:</p>

<pre>
&lt;PortName&gt;
	&lt;SimpleName&gt;<i><span class="folder">COM2</span></i>&lt;/SimpleName>
	&lt;FriendlyName&gt;<i><span class="folder">COM2</span></i>&lt;/FriendlyName>
&lt;/PortName&gt;
&lt;BaudRate&gt;<i><span class="folder">600</span></i>&lt;/BaudRate&gt;
</pre>

<p>The PortName field designates which serial port will be used to relay the data.  This can be a real or virtual comm port.  The BaudRate field sets the baud rate of the Relay port.</p>
