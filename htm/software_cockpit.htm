<h2>Cockpit Configuration</h2>
<p>Cockpit requires an accessory device file to be installed to use PAM.</p>
<p>The accessory device file informs Cockpit how to address the PAM(node id) as well as other parameters. If the accessory device file is
not installed cockpit will not communicate with the PAM and thus communication with the connected device is impossible.</p>
<p><img src ="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> Accessory device files can be created using the vrDeviceConfiguration tool. However,
a factory configured file is typically provided with the PAM.</p>
<p> Any factory configured files provided must be installed into the <span class="folder">C:\Users\VideoRay\AppData\Local\VideoRay\AccessoryDevices\</span> directory
on the computer running cockpit. The accessory device file is an XML file with human readable file names.</p>
<p>There are two fields which may require user modification, in which case a plain text editor such as notepad can be used. The
file is formatted as such:</p>
<pre>
&lt;PortName&gt;
	&lt;SimpleName&gt;<i><span class="folder">COM2</span></i>&lt;/SimpleName>
	&lt;FriendlyName&gt;<i><span class="folder">COM2</span></i>&lt;/FriendlyName>
&lt;/PortName&gt;
&lt;BaudRate&gt;<i><span class="folder">600</span></i>&lt;/BaudRate&gt; </pre>
<p>The PortName field designates which serial port will be used to relay the data.  
This can be a real or virtual comm port.  The BaudRate field sets the baud rate of the Relay port.</p>
<h2>Cockpit Diagnostics</h2>
