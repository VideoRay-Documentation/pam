<h1>Quick Start Instructions</h1>

<p>These Quick Start Instructions are streamlined to cover just the essentials of operating your PAM.  They are provided to get you started as fast as possible, while keeping you and the equipment safe.  They cover the equipment set up and basic operation, but are not intended to result in a comprehensive base of knowledge or set of operational and piloting skills required to use the PAM effectively.  The remaining sections of this documentation should be referenced for a complete understanding of the features, capabilities, operating procedures and maintenance requirements of the PAM.</p>
