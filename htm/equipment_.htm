<h1>Equipment Guide</h1>
<p>This portion of the manual gives in depth details on the equipment necessary to successfully operate the PAM and connected devices. The PAM consists of two important items, the
9-pin which allows access to individual pin functions of the ROV's accessory port, and the PAM circuit board, which divides and interprets the information to allow
the interface of generic accessories.</p>
