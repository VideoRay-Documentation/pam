<h1>Equipment Guide</h1>
This portion of the manual gives in depth details on the equipment necessary to successfully operate the PAM and connected devices.
<h2>9-Pin Whip</h2>
<img src="../../PAM/images/9_pin_whip.png" width = "400">
<p>The 9-Pin whip included with your VideoRay splits the 9-pin accessory port cable into individual wires, allowing the to be attached to the PAM board. Each carries
a different type of data to or from the ROV, as follows:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Pin</th>
		<th>Function</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>Video -</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>Video +</td>

	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>24V DC + (30 Watts)</td>
	</tr>

<h2>PAM Board</h2>
<img src="../../PAM/images/board.png" width = "400"> 
<p>The PAM board serves as an adapter for your serial device. It splits the input from the 9-pin accessory port and allows your device to connect and interface with the ROV,
providing unprecedented end user customization.</p>
<p> The board contains a series of numbered pin connectors. Starting in the top right corner is the first pin, increasing as you move left. This row in the PinOUT side, connecting the
ROV's accessory port to the PAM board with the 9-pin whip. Each pin in the board corresponds to one of the pins from the accessory port. The row immediately below that connects the serial device to the board. These two sets are connected to eachother through the board,
allowing connections to be made between the ROV and serial devices.

<h3>ROV Connection</h3>
<p>Connect the the 9-pin whip to the ROV, and isolate the four needed wires. Place the board with the pinOut side facing upwards. In this position, the pin numbers
for the PAM board start at 1 in the upper right and increase towards the left. From this position, begin to connect the wires from the 9-pin whip to the board in the following
manner:
<ul>
	<li>Connect the Orange ground wire to pin 5.</li>
	<li>(Optional) If you are using 24V power, connect the 24V power wire to pin 3.</li>
	<li>Connect the Gray RS485- wire to pin 7.</li>
	<li>Connect the Blue RS485+ wire to pin 8.</li>
	<li>Connect the Brown 12V power wire to pin 9.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have finished connecting the cables to the board, it should look very much like the picture.<br>
<img src="../../PAM/images/icon_note.gif">	If you are using 24V power you should have one extra wire connected to the board. It should be connected to pin 3.</p>
	
<h3>Device Connection</h3>
<img src ="../../PAM/images/board2.png" width = "400">
<p>After you have connected the 9-pin whip correctly, the next step is to connect the wires from your serial device to the PAM board. The PAM board uses the row of pins
under the PinOUT set for the connection to serial devices. This is the PinIN side of the board. The following steps will successfully connect your device:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identify which wires on your device are communications, power, and ground.</li>
	<li>Connect your devices ground wire to pin 5.</li>
	<li>(Optional)If you are using 24V power, connect your devices 24V power wire to pin 3.</li>
	<li>Connect your devices communications pins.</li>
		<ul>	
			<li>If you are using an RS485 device, the connection order is reversed on this side. Connect your devices RS485+ wire to pin 7. Connect your devices
			RS485- wire to pin 8.</li>
			<li>If you are using an RS232 device, connect the TX wire of your device to pin 7. Connect the RX wire to pin 8. </li>
		</ul>
	<li>Connect your devices power.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If you are connecting a 12V device, connect your power wire to pin 12.</li>
			<li>If you are connecting a 24V device, connect your power wire to pin 3.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
