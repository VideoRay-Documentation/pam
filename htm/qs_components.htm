<h1>PAM Components</h1>

<p>The PAM consists of a single board and a 9-pin whip. The 9-pin whip connects to the 9-pin accessory port on the top of the ROV. The whip provides individual wires from the
9 pin connector.
The board has a pin out and pin in side.  The PINOut side attaches to wiring from the 9-pin whip. The PINIn side attaches to wiring from the serial
device being attached to the ROV.</p>
