<p>The PAM is intended for users who have familiarity with their custom device and would like to integrate it with a VideoRay Pro 4.  The PAM will require soldering power and data communications lines.  Programming the PAM is a simple process, but understanding the information coming from your device requires familiarity with its data protocol. After soldered and programmed, the PAM needs to be enclosed in a waterproof housing.</p>
