<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>The PAM is intended for developers and programmers who have familiarity with their custom device. Ideally the individual most familiar with the device should set up the PAM.
The contacts on the PAM board are small, and require some experience in soldering to connect wires to. Programming the PAM is a basic process, but understanding the information
coming from your device requires an individual familiar with data protocols. After soldered and programmed, the PAM needs to be enclosed in a waterproof housing.</p>

<p>In most cases, how to operate your device during a dive will be included in the devices operating manual.
Instructions for how to operate all devices compatible with the PAM during a dive are outside the scope of this document,
but we encourage you to review any documents pertaining to your device to ensure the proper usage of all equipment.</p>
