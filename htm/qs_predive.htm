<h1>Quick Setup</h1>
<p>This quick start guide will let you get to using your device as fast as possible. While useful, especially for those with little time, it is not a substitue
for the full text of this manual. If you need more information about your PAM device, please consult the other sections of this manual for more details.
<h2>ROV Connection</h2>

<p>Connect the the 9-pin whip to the ROV, and isolate the four needed wires. Place the board with the pinOut side facing upwards. In this position, the pin numbers
for the PAM board start at 1 in the upper right and increase towards the left. From this position, begin to connect the wires from the 9-pin whip to the board in the following
manner:
<ul>
	<li>Connect the Orange ground wire to pin 5.</li>
	<li>(Optional) If you are using 24V power, connect the 24V power wire to pin 3.</li>
	<li>Connect the Gray RS485- wire to pin 7.</li>
	<li>Connect the Blue RS485+ wire to pin 8.</li>
	<li>Connect the Brown 12V power wire to pin 9.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have finished connecting the cables to the board, it should look very much like the picture.<br>

<h2>Device Connection</h2>

<p>After you have connected the 9-pin whip correctly, the next step is to connect the wires from your serial device to the PAM board. The PAM board uses the row of pins
under the PinOUT set for the connection to serial devices. This is the PinIN side of the board. The following steps will successfully connect your device:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identify which wires on your device are communications, power, and ground.</li>
	<li>Connect your devices ground wire to pin 5.</li>
	<li>(Optional)If you are using 24V power, connect your devices 24V power wire to pin 3.</li>
	<li>Connect your devices communications pins.</li>
		<ul>	
			<li>If you are using an RS485 device, the connection order is reversed on this side. Connect your devices RS485+ wire to pin 7. Connect your devices
			RS485- wire to pin 8.</li>
			<li>If you are using an RS232 device, connect the TX wire of your device to pin 7. Connect the RX wire to pin 8. </li>
		</ul>
	<li>Connect your devices power.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If you are connecting a 12V device, connect your power wire to pin 12.</li>
			<li>If you are connecting a 24V device, connect your power wire to pin 3.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Device Configuration</h2>
<p>In most cases, the PAM is factory configured for the end user, and no action is needed. In the case that you need to configure the PAM
device yourself please see the <a href ="../../PAM/html/software_.html"> software guide. </a> </p>
