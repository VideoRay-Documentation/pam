<p>Our Cockpit software allows you to monitor the status of all connected PAM devices in realtime. First click the <b>Maintenance and Diagnostic</b> button
on the launch bar in Cockpit. From here press the <b>show communications diagnostic window</b> button on the service bay screen, and the
screen above will appear, allowing you to view data on your attached PAM devices.</p>

<p>In most cases, how to operate your device during a dive will be included in the devices operating manual.
Instructions for how to operate all devices compatible with the PAM during a dive are outside the scope of this document,
but we encourage you to review any documents pertaining to your device to ensure the proper usage of all equipment.</p>
