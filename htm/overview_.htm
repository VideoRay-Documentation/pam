<h1>PAM (Protocol Adapter Multiplexer) Overview</h1>

<p>VideoRay is pleased to introduce the PAM accessory module for your Pro 4 ROV. The PAM module allows for the connection of low bandwidth serial devices to your Pro 4 via the 9-pin accessory port, without needing to use a spare pair for communications.  Instead the data to and from the PAM is sent along the ROV's communications bus, adding extreme customization and versatility in accessories.  Along with VideoRay's Cockpit software, the PAM acts as a transparent interface for your serial devices. The PAM supports a RS-232 and RS-485 communication protocols, and functions with devices running on 12v or 24v power.  The PAM also includes A/D conversion PWM and 5 V GPIO capabilities, but these are not addressed in this manual.</p>
