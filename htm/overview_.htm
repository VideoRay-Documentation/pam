<h1>Generic Protocol Adapter Multiplexer (PAM) Overview</h1>

<p>VideoRay is pleased to introduce the PAM accessory module for your Pro 4 ROV. The PAM
module allows for the connection of a low bandwidth serial device to your Pro 4 via the 9-pin accessory port, without needing to use a spare pair.
Instead the data to and from the PAM is sent along the communications bus, adding extreme customization and versatility in accessories. 
Along with VideoRay's Cockpit software, the PAM acts as a transparent interface for your serial devices. The PAM supports a variety of communication protocols, and functions with
devices running on 12v or 24v power.</p>
